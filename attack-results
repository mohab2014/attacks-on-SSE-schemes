Example:
=======
The following example taken from the Adult's solutions shows a possible solution corresponding to a column cardinality 2.
Note that i:j means the ith query has a result size that is equal to j. Note that the summation of all the result sizes should equal the number of records. So, 7841+ 24720 = 32561, the number of records in the Adult dataset,
 
Solution # 1, card = 2, confirmations = 2
