Each folder contains three files. One file holds the observed query matrix, another file holding the meta-data info about column names 
and their cardinalities. Also there is another file containing the actual queries in their order. That means the query at line 'i' is the 
ith query. This file is used to check whether our first attack recovers the actual the attribute name of each qeury 'i' or whether our 
second attack recovers the actual value of the ith query.
